<h2>Mechatronics</h2>
<div class="rightImage"><a href="/images/mechatronics/solidworks.png" data-lightbox="mechatronics" data-title="Initial design of Perseverance."><img src="/images/mechatronics/solidworks.png"></a></div>
I joined SDSU's <a href="http://www.sdsumechatronics.org" target="_blank">Mechatronics</a> club at the start of my sophomore year. The club is made up of over 20 students, ranging in discipline from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Business. Every year we compete in San Diego's International <a href="http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub" target="_blank">Robosub</a> competition, which consists of about 40 teams from all over the world. <br /><br />

<div class="leftImage"><a href="/images/mechatronics/subtable.png" data-lightbox="mechatronics" data-title="Perseverance on the table, getting ready for pool testing!"><img src="/images/mechatronics/subtable.png"></a></div>
My role in the team started as an apprentice and over time I have made my way up, as I am currently in a leadership position. My contribution to our current AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle), Perseverance, has consisted of GUI design and integration, embedded systems programming, and autonomous algorithms. Perseverance uses the <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/" target="_blank">Darknet</a> neural network for training object detection. <div class="rightImage"><a href="/images/mechatronics/diver.png" data-lightbox="mechatronics" data-title="The diver with our sub in SPAWAR's Transdec (competition pool)."><img src="/images/mechatronics/diver.png"></a></div> I have also began developing a software for labeling the images that Perseverance takes when in the water. We need the objects within the images labeled so that the AUV can learn what it is looking at. This software would have a frontend web application for the labeling, and a backend server with a database to store the labels and images. The labels on the server are put into Darknet's algorithm to train the AUV. <br /><br />

The whole software team works together to innovate the most efficient way for our AUV to detect the obstacles and do proper movement such as bumping buoys, going through gates, etc. All the divisions of the team work together to make sure each student has well-rounded knowledge of each aspect of our vehicle, which makes problem solving much quicker. <br /><br />


<h2>SPAWAR Internship</h2>
Currently, I have an internship position at SPAWAR, where I help conduct research. Since the project I am working on is confidential, I cannot go into details about the intent of the project, but it is somewhat related to the work I do with the Mechatronics team. I am also in the process of getting my secret clearance.<br /><br />

The division of the project that I work in deals with networking, such as communication between devices. My major project that I was assigned involves XML packets and the interpretation of them. I've been programming in C# to properly handle these packets as well as extract certain variables that are sent within them. I use these variables to create and update a 3D world simulation using a software called <a href="http://agi.com/home" target="_blank">STK</a>. <br /><br />

STK has quite a robust API that I have had to learn to be able to program with it and manipulate it in the way I need. It is very useful for modeling any kind of scenario using ground vehicles, aircrafts, satellites, and buildings.
