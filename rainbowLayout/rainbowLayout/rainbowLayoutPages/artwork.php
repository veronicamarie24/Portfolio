		<h1>Digital Art</h1>
		&emsp;During the Fall 2017 semester, I took a digital art and web design course at SDSU. Our main project consisted of branding, where we created our own logo and brand style. We went through a process of sketching 50+ different logo ideas, creating vector art from these sketches, and doing color studies. These logos are the ones that I designed in Illustrator from my favorite sketches. I ended up with the logo that is seen in the header of my website, but it was a hard decision!
		<br /><br/ ><br />
		&emsp;The class final project was to make a website featuring all of the projects we did during the class. This website needed to have convenient site navigation, consistent color palette, and a specified set of fonts. <span><a href="/pages/art240website/index.html" target="_blank">&#8674;View Website</a></span>

		<h1>Painting and Drawing</h1>
		&emsp;While my focus is digital art, I also have experience with painting and drawing. I've taken two art classes at SDSU where we worked with 2D design concepts like contrast, unity, proportion, color, and value. These concepts are also valuable in digital artwork. <br /><br />
		&emsp;Painting is also a hobby of mine, so I often do watercolor painting in my free time and as gifts for friends. I enjoy art in its professional sense, as well as a purely creative outlet, which allows me to explore different techniques and styles.
