		<h1>Mechatronics</h1>
		<a href="http://www.sdsumechatronics.org" target="_blank">Mechatronics</a> is a robotics club at SDSU. I work alongside a group of engineers (mechanical, electrical, and computer science) to make an autonomous underwater vehicle to compete in San Diego's International Robosub Competition. <span><a href="/pages/programming.php">&#8674;More</a></span>

		<h1>Brand Design</h1>
		Since I'm an interdisciplinary student, I consistently develop my skills in both programming and art. While I love painting and drawing, digital art has become my focus. I've recently created a series of logos for myself with Adobe Illustrator while also learning other Adobe applications like Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver.<span><a href="/pages/artwork.php">&#8674;More</a></span>
