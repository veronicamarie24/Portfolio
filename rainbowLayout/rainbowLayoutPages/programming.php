		<h1>Mechatronics</h1>
		&emsp;I joined SDSU's <a href="http://www.sdsumechatronics.org" target="_blank">Mechatronics</a> club at the start of my sophomore year. The club is made up of over 20 students, ranging in discipline from Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Business. Every year we compete in San Diego's International <a href="http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub" target="_blank">Robosub</a> competition, which consists of about 40 teams from all over the world. 
		<br /><br />
		&emsp;My role in the team started as an apprentice and over time I have made my way up, as I am currently being prepared for a leadership position. My contribution to our current AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle), Perseverance, has consisted of GUI design and integration, embedded systems programming, and autonomous algorithms. Perseverance uses the <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/" target="_blank">Darknet</a> neural network for object detection and autonomy. 
		<br /><br />
		&emsp;The whole software team works together to innovate the most efficient way for our AUV to detect the obstacles and do proper movement such as bumping buoys, going through gates, etc. All the divisions of the team work together to make sure each student has well-rounded knowledge of each aspect of our vehicle, which makes problem solving much quicker.

		<h1>Internship at SPAWAR</h1>
		&emsp;Currently, I have an internship position at SPAWAR, where I help conduct research. Since the project I am working on is confidential, I cannot go into details about the intent of the project, but it is somewhat related to the work I do with the Mechatronics team. 
		<br /><br />
		&emsp;The division of the project that I work in deals with networking, such as communication between devices. My major project that I have been assigned involves network packets and the interpretation of them. I've been programming in C# to properly handle the packets as well as extract the information I need from them to update a 3D world simulation software called <a href="http://agi.com/home" target="_blank">STK</a>. Working with the specific functions of STK to program with it has definitely been a huge learning experience.
