			<h1>About Me</h1>
			My name is Veronica Valenzuela, and I’m a curious learner with a lot of ambition. This ambition works well with the fact that I have a lot of ideas to execute!<br /><br />

			I developed an interest in web design at a young age (because of Neopets.com and their HTML tutorial), and I’ve been loving it ever since. <br /><br />

			My main focus right now is honing my skills in frontend and backend web development.
