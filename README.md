# Pink and Gray Portfolio
This is the portfolio I wrote from scratch using HTML5 and CSS3. I've redesigned my website a few times, and soon I will upload each version to Github to record them all.

I am in the process of adding some JavaScript functionality to this layout, but I'm already thinking of new designs, so I might just wait to incorporate new features into my next layout!

I've recently gained some knowledge of Bootstrap and React, so I really want to test those out with my next redesign. Stay tuned! ;)
