<h1>About Me</h1>

I grew up in <a href="/images/aboutme/fremontmap.png" data-lightbox="fremont" data-title="Fremont, CA">Fremont, CA</a> and then moved to <a href="/images/aboutme/hersheymap.png" data-lightbox="hershey" data-title="Hershey, PA">Hershey, PA</a> during high school. When I told everyone I was moving to Hershey, they all laughed because they know I hate chocolate (which might have been an omen). <br /><br />

Nah, Hershey wasn't that bad. But when I graduated high school, I definitely wanted to come back to California. So, I decided to go to San Diego State University to get my Computer Science degree, which is what I'm currently doing!<br /><br />

I love San Diego and I'm really enjoying my time at SDSU. I added a digital art minor to my degree to better express my artistic side. I've been web designing since I was 12 years old, and I knew I wanted to keep doing that. I get to do what I love while also doing homework, which makes me excited for my future. Coding has always been a passion of mine and I can't wait to make my ideas into reality with all the knowledge I'm gaining every day.<br /><br />
