During the Fall 2017 semester, I took a digital art and web design course at SDSU. Our main project consisted of branding, where we created our own logo and brand style. We went through a process of sketching 50+ different logo ideas, creating vector art from these sketches, and doing color studies. <br /><br />
The logos above are the ones that I designed in Adobe Illustrator from my favorite sketches. I ended up with the logo that is seen in the sidebar of my website, but it was a hard decision! <br /><br /><br />

<h2>Interactive Phone Interface Prototype</h2>
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that acted as an interactive phone interface to display a prototype. We were told to use only HTML, CSS, and Javascript to allow the user to change screens and click apps. The professor also told us we must make it with a steampunk aesthetic in mind. I took the idea of steampunk and took it in a pixel-art and video game style direction. <br /><br /><br />

<h2>One Page Scrolling Website</h2>
The class final project was to make a website featuring all of the projects we did during the class. This website needed to have convenient site navigation, consistent color palette, and a specified set of fonts. Since it was only one page, I used divs as "pages" to link the user to different portions of the page. <a href="/pages/art240website/index.html" target="_blank">View Website</a>
