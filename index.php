<h2>Mechatronics</h2>
<a href="http://www.sdsumechatronics.org" target="_blank">Mechatronics</a> is a robotics club at SDSU. I work alongside a group of engineers (mechanical, electrical, and computer science) to make an autonomous underwater vehicle to compete in San Diego's International Robosub Competition. <a href="/programming.php">Learn More</a>

<h2>Logo Design</h2>
Since I'm an interdisciplinary student, I consistently develop my skills in both programming and art. While I love painting and drawing, digital art has become my focus. I've recently created a series of logos for myself with Adobe Illustrator while also learning other Adobe applications like Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver. <a href="/artwork.php">Learn More</a>
