			Since I'm an interdisciplinary student, I consistently develop my skills in both programming and digital art. I've recently created a series of logos for myself with Adobe Illustrator while also learning other Adobe applications like Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver. I also designed this portfolio from scratch.
